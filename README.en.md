[中文说明](README.md)

**ADOFAIMacro** is a UnityModManager mod for **A Dance of Fire and Ice (ADOFAI)**: it parses level floor timestamps and fires keys with microsecond-precision timing from a dedicated high-priority thread. From "direct judge triggering" to "system-level key simulation" to "two-hand technique simulation", it covers everything from fully automated clears to realistic hand-play styles.

> ⚠️ **Two hard rules, up front:**
> - **Do not modify `Info.json`** — the mod ships with tamper detection; modifying it makes the game quit on enable.
> - **Incompatible with BaseMacro** — detection causes the game to quit.

## Feature Overview

- **Auto triggering**: level timestamps → precision-timed key events; double-buffered time anchors sync the main and worker threads, lock-free with zero waiting.
- **Four input paths**: direct judge / SendInput / SkyHook low-level injection (NtInject / NtSendInput) / virtual async keyboard direct-feed (bypasses system injection, sub-microsecond jitter).
- **Technique simulation**: left/right hand alternation, automatic time-slice subdivision above a BPM threshold (multi-finger single-hand streams), configurable keys / orders / press durations (per-slice accent "strong–weak" patterns), speed segments, per-level configs; the core algorithm runs in a native C++ DLL with offline solving and trace caching.
- **Trace player**: the whole chart's technique is solved and cached during level loading (zero computation when you hit Start); export / import `.adofaitrace` files for sharing, with time-driven / angle-driven playback.
- **Timing fine-tuning**: ±100 ms offset, adjustable in-game with arrow keys; automatic judge-error calibration (closed-loop, cancels speed-section offsets).
- **Key filtering**: blacklist / whitelist, independent sync (KeyCode) and async (VK code) filters; passes through the 4 special keys the game hard-blocks (PrintScreen / F12 / LAlt / Super).
- **Extras**: auto keypress on death, GC pause suppression during play, out-of-focus guard, macro status badge (HIT / VIRT / NT / SI) with on-screen virtual keys, English/Chinese UI.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: ADOFAI installed, [UnityModManager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21) (≥ 0.27.0).

1. Download the archive from [Releases](https://github.com/adofaiex/ADOFAIMacro/releases) and install via UMM, or manually extract it into the game's `Mods/ADOFAIMacro/` folder.
   - The folder should contain: `ADOFAIMacro.dll`, `InputSystem.dll`, `TechniqueSimulator.dll`, and `Localization/` (zh-CN / en-US).
2. Launch the game, open the UMM mod window, and enable **ADOFAIMacro**.
3. In the **Macro** tab, check **Enable Macro**.
4. The defaults (key simulation off = direct judge) will auto-play the level. If hits feel consistently early/late, adjust **Offset (ms)** in the **Offset Settings** tab, or tap <kbd>←</kbd>/<kbd>→</kbd> in-game.

That's it. For more, read on.

## Trigger Modes & Input Paths

Three toggles in **Key Settings** combine into four paths:

| What you want | Configuration |
|---|---|
| Just clear the level, shortest path | Key simulation **off** |
| Real system keys (visuals, key sounds, third-party tools reading the keyboard) | Key simulation **on** + Use advanced input **off** (SendInput) |
| High-frequency charts / multi-software setups / SendInput blocked | Key simulation **on** + Use advanced input **on** + Input Mode **Auto** |
| Maximum sync precision | The row above + **Virtual async keyboard** on (default) |

Path details:

1. **Direct judge** (`SimulateKeyPress = false`): the worker thread counts hits → the main thread calls the game's `Hit()`. Zero system side effects and the most predictable latency, but the game treats it as an automatic hit — no real keypresses are produced.
2. **SendInput**: standard Win32 injection, best compatibility.
3. **SkyHook advanced input**: goes through `InputSystem.dll` to lower layers. Input Mode options:
   - **Auto**: picks the lowest available layer automatically (start here);
   - **NtInject**: deepest layer, injects into the raw input stream;
   - **NtSendInput ★**: kernel-boundary injection;
   - **SendInput**: same as standard Win32.
4. **Virtual async keyboard**: synthesizes key events and feeds them straight into the game's own input queue (the same entry point as the real keyboard hook), skipping the entire system-injection chain. Timestamps are generated locally with sub-microsecond jitter and no window-focus dependency. When unavailable (unmapped key, layout check failure) it **automatically falls back** to injection — no manual action needed.

## Settings Reference

Organized by UMM panel tab. "Internal name" is the field used in the config file.

### Macro

| Panel item | Internal name | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enable Macro | `Macro` | off | Master switch. |
| Enable logging (nothing written to Player.log when off) | `EnableLogging` | on | When off the mod writes no logs; technique-table / diagnostic dump files are unaffected. |

### Key Settings

| Panel item | Internal name | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Keys (comma separated) | `MacroKeys` | `D,F,J,K` | Key sequence for simple rotation mode. |
| Key simulation | `SimulateKeyPress` | off | Off = direct judge; on = system key simulation. |
| Use advanced input | `SkyHookMode` | off | On = SkyHook path; off = SendInput. |
| Virtual async keyboard | `UseVirtualAsyncInput` | on | See path 4 above; auto-fallback when unavailable. |
| Mirror virtual keys to system input | `MirrorVirtualKeys` | on | After a successful direct-feed, also injects one real keypress so key-viewer tools can see virtual keys; injection echoes are dropped automatically — no double hits. |
| Win API Input Mode | `InputMode` | Auto | Auto / NtInject / NtSendInput ★ / SendInput. |

## Technique Simulation Guide

When enabled (requires **Key simulation**), the macro stops simply rotating the key list and instead simulates two human hands: time is divided into slices, each slice is assigned to one hand, alternating left/right. When event density exceeds the **Speed Threshold (BPM)**, slices are subdivided so one hand plays multiple events in a row — single-hand multi-finger streams.

### Basic parameters

| Panel item | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Enable Technique Simulation (L/R alternation) | off | Master switch (requires Key simulation; Release builds also require `TechniqueSimulator.dll`). |
| Starting Hand | Right | Which hand plays the first slice. |
| Global · Speed Threshold (BPM) | 500 | Subdivide slices above this BPM (range 50 ~ 2000). |
| L/R Keys | `D,F` / `J,K` | Keys available to each hand; presets DF/JK, DS/JK, ASDF/JKL. |
| L/R Order | empty | See format below; empty = default rotation. |
| L/R Ratio | `0.8,0.8` | Press-duration ratio (0 ~ 1): how much of the slice a key stays held; hold notes are handled automatically. |

**Order format**: pipe separates key-count groups, commas separate 1-based indices. Example `1,2 | 1,2 | 1,2,1`: one-key slices alternate keys 1 and 2, three-key slices play 1→2→1. Empty = default order.

**The "strong–weak" accent mechanism**: the order row is picked **by the number of events in the slice** — a slice containing N events uses row N of the order table (clamped to the last row), and every key in that row carries its own press-duration ratio. Dense runs therefore produce a natural strong→weak accent cycle (e.g. a 3-event slice plays `50→1.2 / 51→1 / 82→0.8`). This is why the order table has multiple rows: with only row 1 filled in, multi-event slices have no accent layer.

**Boundary guard (fake-jump fix)**: adjacent notes across a cross-hand slice boundary with a gap under one frame (~16.7 ms) are merged into the earlier slice (capped by that hand's key count, never emptied out of the next slice, never merged across speed-change points), eliminating triplets played as synchronized two-hand hits while preserving the next slice's multi-event nature — the accent pattern survives. Slice length itself is determined purely by per-floor speed (the old "Speed Change Tolerance" has been removed); slice boundaries align to the time grid so the same rhythm pattern keeps a stable starting hand.

### Profiles

Save multiple complete technique parameter sets (keys, orders, durations, starting hand, segments); create / delete / switch from the panel.

### Speed Segments

Override global settings within a floor range: each segment can set its own **BPM limit** and **L/R keys / orders / ratios** (empty fields inherit global). Hand order resets and cross-segment holds are released at segment boundaries.

### Level-specific Configs

Each level can have its own config:

- Stored next to the level file, named `LevelName.adofaimacro.json`;
- Auto-loaded on entry ("Auto-load from level folder", on by default);
- Load / Save / Delete from the bottom of the panel, with current status display.

Useful for smaller key sets on high-BPM sections, custom orders for specific patterns, or per-level fine-tuning.

### Trace Player & Trace Cache

The bottom of the technique panel is the **Trace Player**. With technique simulation enabled, the whole chart's technique is solved and cached during level loading — ready before you press Start; entering the same chart again reads the cache with zero computation. The solve fingerprint covers chart + full technique config + a content hash of the solver DLL — change anything and it automatically re-solves, never reusing stale caches.

- **Driver**: time-driven (default, uses the original time-anchor chain) / angle-driven (triggers by the angle the planet has swept across the current tile, immune to clock jitter; quantized by frame rate so it can be one frame late — compensate with "Angle lead (ms)", range −200 ~ 400).
- **Solve now**: manually re-solve the current level at any time.
- **Export / import trace**: exports the current chart's `.adofaitrace` file for sharing; importing validates that it is the same chart + same technique config (fingerprint check), then applies after re-entering the level.
- **Clear trace cache**: caches live under the game's `persistentDataPath/ADOFAIMacro/trace/`, clearable with one click.

### Notes

- The core algorithm runs in the native `TechniqueSimulator.dll` — make sure it is in `Mods/ADOFAIMacro/`. **Release builds produce no technique output without the DLL** (debug builds fall back to the C# implementation).

## In-Game Hotkeys

| Keys | Action | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| <kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>→</kbd> | Offset ± step | Arrow adjust enabled |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>→</kbd> | Step ±0.1 | Ctrl adjust enabled |

Test on short levels first, then move to long / dense charts.

## Troubleshooting

**Q1: Macro enabled but nothing happens**
Check in order: mod enabled in UMM → Enable Macro checked → key sequence valid (comma-separated) → if "Block key input when window is unfocused" is on, keys are skipped while the game is unfocused (resume by focusing it).

**Q2: Timing inconsistent, occasional drops**
Fine-tune the offset with arrow keys (1 ms steps); for high-frequency charts enable advanced input + Auto mode; for dense charts enable GC pause suppression; if still conflicting, enable the key filter to isolate the source.

**Q3: Large offsets on speed-change charts**
Make sure auto judge-error calibration is on (default); under technique simulation, give the speed section its own BPM limit via segments. Slice length follows per-floor speed automatically — there is no (and no longer any) speed-change tolerance to tune.

**Q4: Death key doesn't work**
Requires both Key simulation and Use advanced input (SkyHook) — confirm both are on; confirm the death key is enabled and the key name / code is valid; increase the delay if needed.

**Q5: Key-viewer tools can't see macro keys**
The virtual async keyboard bypasses the system input stream, so third-party tools can't read it — enable "Mirror virtual keys to system input" (on by default). The green badge and on-screen virtual keys (top-left corner) are rendered by the mod itself and are unaffected.

**Q6: Key filter "does nothing"**
Confirm the filter is enabled; confirm the mode (black/whitelist) matches your intent; under advanced input, don't forget the **async** key list. PrintScreen / F12 / LAlt / Super (Win key) work as macro keys with no extra setup — the mod passes through these four keys that the game hard-blocks.

**Q7: The game quits right after enabling the mod**
`Info.json` was modified (tamper detection) — restore it; or BaseMacro is installed (mutually exclusive) — remove it.

**Q8: Technique simulation produces nothing / DLL unavailable**
Place `TechniqueSimulator.dll` in `Mods/ADOFAIMacro/`; Release builds generate no technique events without the DLL.

**Q9: Judgement drifts when first entering the game**
Auto judge-error calibration keeps converging during play; usually no manual action is needed. For a persistent offset, compensate manually with "Offset (ms)". Larger error on the very first run is normal (calibration samples come from the current run and are not carried across runs).

When filing an issue, please include: game version, mod version, key settings screenshots, whether SkyHook is used and the current input mode, reproduction steps and logs.

## Building (Developers)

- Environment: Visual Studio 2022 or newer (with MSBuild), .NET Framework 4.8.1, C# preview.
- C# side: `ADOFAIMacro/ADOFAIMacro-Dev.csproj` is an SDK-style project (NuGet via `PackageReference`, restored automatically); game assemblies are referenced through the `$(GameManaged)` property pointing at your local ADOFAI install — you need the game's `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, `UnityEngine*.dll`, `SkyHook.Unity.dll`, `UnityModManager.dll`, plus `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` (used by the localization system). Just build Release with MSBuild.
- Native side: run `cmd /c build_cpp.bat` at the repo root to build both C++ projects (`TechniqueSimulator` / `InputSystem`, each Debug + Release). **After changing native code you must fully rebuild (`/t:Rebuild`) — incremental builds may pick up stale artifacts.**
- Deploy to `Mods/ADOFAIMacro/`: `ADOFAIMacro.dll` + `Localization/` + `InputSystem.dll` + `TechniqueSimulator.dll`.
